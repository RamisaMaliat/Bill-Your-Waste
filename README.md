## Inspiration
In Bangladesh, waste management is a looming problem often shoved aside in favor of more ‘pressing’ matters. Under the current waste management system, only about 80% of the waste is being collected. Even then, a lot of the waste collected isn't disposed of properly, leading to pollution and harmful effects on the population's health. While the government can and should set up an efficient waste management system, the only way to really eradicate this problem is with the help of us, the youth. Hence, it was an attempt to come up with an environment-friendly, technology-based, innovative and citizen-centered waste management system.

## What it does
BillYourWaste is a simple web application through which we can ensure an efficient waste management system in the entire country while offering an easy-to-follow experience for our users. We believe this is the best way to technologically reduce a major issue amidst the global pandemic. This web app will provide the service of picking up waste, specified by its category, from a given address. Users of BillYourWaste will range from people living in small residential areas to big industries of the country that are generating tons of waste every day. The waste will be collected and taken to allocated landfills for further segregation. After final sorting, reusable and recyclable items will be set aside for buying. <br />
The web app is designed to have two account types: Merchant account & Consumer account. 
- Merchants will sell their waste to us in exchange of money and 
- Consumers will buy reusable and recyclable waste from us.

## How it is built
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJs <br />
Backend: Python, SQL, Django <br />
Database: Sqlite3

## What's next for BillYourWaste
- Subscription system for Merchants: Merchants can sign up for weekly, monthly or quarterly subscription in which we will collect waste for that specific period of time without them having to fill up a daily form. Things required: Subscription type, category, minimum amount and pickup address. 
- Email Notifications for Consumers: Consumers may choose to receive a regular email from us on recent stock levels for a specific category. 
- Money Transfer feasibility for Consumers: Instead of Cash on Delivery, they can pay us via nagad/bkash/bank account. 
- Expansion: Initially the web app will be launched in the major cities of Bangladesh, for example Dhaka, Chittagong, and Sylhet. In the near future, once the company rises to a position of profitability, the business will be expanded and the app will be launched in other districts of Bangladesh as well.
